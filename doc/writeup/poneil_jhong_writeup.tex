\begin{abstract}
  We built a server in order to perform multiple exact local alignment problems. This server manages a storage database and worker nodes in order to handle queries made by clients. As clients send many local alignment problem requests, we want to be able to store and cache previous solutions for use later. The client-server architecture will provide a framework for this task. 
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
Why work on this? Why your approach?

The task of local alignment is a frequently queried task in Computational Genomics. When many queries are made, there might be some similar structure across all of the tasks that could be taken advantage of. For example, when aligning gene sequences, similar sequences might reoccur because they were all taken from a single group of microorganisms, or even simply because of the limited permutations of the alphabet A,C,G,T. 

We chose to build a server in order to recieve alignment requests, store past queries, and then return the result. The server could then try to fetching a solution from a database, or solve the problem when none were available.
